		<Sent id="2.2">I will place in your housing application as my colleagues are in the midst of sorting out room assignments. There's still time, so let me know the estimated date of arrival and departure and I assume you would like to have single graduate apartment AIRCOM at UTown.</Sent>
        <Sent id="2.3">Let me know.</Sent>

        <Sent id="7.1">Dear Silah,</Sent>
        <Sent id="7.2">I see what you are saying about the check­in.</Sent>
        <Sent id="7.3">I have just reviewed my flight and I can change it so that I arrive on the 7th, i.e the Monday.</Sent>
        <Sent id="7.4">Would that make it easier from an administrative standpoint?</Sent>

        <Sent id="8.1">Hi Angus,
		<Sent id="8.2">Yes, it will make it easier (esp. about the deposit part) but we are doing this for other students, so it’s ok.</Sent>
        <Sent id="8.3">The important thing is that you give yourself sufficient time to settle down.</Sent>
        <Sent id="8.4">If you think that May 7 will still works for you, then just let me know.</Sent>
